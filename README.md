# DungeonGen

Dungeon Gen is a very basic procedurally generated dungeon crawler with some shooter and rogue-lite elements.

The dungeon will change every time you start a new game and its dimensions will scale along with the current level you are. The weapons and the enemies you'll find also scale with the level you are, so as the game gets tougher the weapons you can get will have a more important role.
